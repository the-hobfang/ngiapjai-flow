# 🧘‍♀️ Welcome to your Expo App – *เงียบใจ*  

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It serves as the foundation for your mobile application – designed to support peace of mind, emotional reflection, and inner calm.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App

```bash
npx expo start
```

You’ll then be able to choose how to run the app:

- In a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- On an [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- In an [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- Using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your physical device

## 📁 Project Structure

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), and the main development happens inside the `app` directory.  
Start editing files there to begin building your experience.

---

## 🔄 Reset to a Fresh Project

If you'd like to start fresh, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will:

- Move the starter code to an `app-example` folder
- Create a new blank `app` directory for your development
